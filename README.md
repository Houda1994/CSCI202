README - Pointers in C/C++
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of pointers in C/C++ by covering various concepts such as pointer declaration, initialization, pointer arithmetic, and the relationship between arrays and pointers. It includes examples showing how to work with pointers in different scenarios, such as accessing array elements, handling empty arrays, and performing pointer arithmetic to directly access specific elements.

Project Content
Scenario 1: Demonstrates how pointer arithmetic is used to traverse an array with multiple elements.
Scenario 2: Shows how to handle an empty array using pointers.
Scenario 3: Illustrates how pointer arithmetic can be used to access a specific element within an array.
Features
Pointer Declaration and Initialization:
A pointer is declared and initialized with the address of a variable.
Pointer Access:
A variable is accessed through its pointer using the dereference operator *.
Pointer Arithmetic:
Demonstrates how pointers can be incremented or decremented to access subsequent elements in an array.
Array and Pointer Relationship:
Explains how the array name acts as a pointer to its first element, allowing pointer arithmetic to be performed on it.
How to Compile and Run
Save the Code:

Copy each of the three C++ code snippets into separate .cpp files (e.g., scenario1.cpp, scenario2.cpp, scenario3.cpp).
Compile the Code:

Use a C++ compiler such as g++ to compile the program.
Example:

g++ scenario1.cpp -o scenario1
Run the Program:

After compilation, execute the program:
Example:
bash

./scenario1
